## Problem Statement:
**Given JSON Dataset of Nobel Prize winners, create a program which will load the information from the JSON file (see the link below) and allow a user to:**
1. Search a Nobel prize winner by name

2. Find out Nobel prize winner in a year input by him

3. Search Prize winner based on the year and category (Peace/Chemistry/Physics etc...)

4. Show a list of all Winners in Alphabetical order (With year and category against the name)

**Link to the data:**
**https://drive.google.com/open?id=1udrhAEPkI0F2IFfcHa9qcpDmdoLFGMST**

**Expected outcome:**
-   You can use any programming language (Java/Python/JavaScript).
-   You can download the data and store it locally in your program.
-   Build 4 APIs / services for each of the operations listed above.
-   Check in the code in GitHub and send us the link to the repository.
-   Optional: Write unit tests for the code if time permits.
-   Document the instructions to run and execute the code.
